    <h2> Proxmox Hypervisor</h2>
    <img src="imgs\proxmox.png" class="proxmox" alt="Picture of prox" >
    <ul>
      <li> For the past 8 months I have been running a Type 1 hypervisor on a server
        I run in my closet, it certainly has been a learning experience but a fun
        one at that </li>
      <li> Initially I started with Hyper-V and moved to ESXI. I had lots of fun with ESXI but wanted to try the
      open source options available</li>
      <li> I've done many fun things like GPU Passthrough and modifiying the software of a PCI-E raid card to add additional SATA ports to my
        computer, when my motherboard has run out </li>
      <li> I like to run TRUENAS and specificly their newest release called SCALE, which was redesigned from the ground up </li>
    </ul>
